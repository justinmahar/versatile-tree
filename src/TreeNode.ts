/**
 * A TreeNode can be used to build a tree structure in JavaScript.
 *
 * Each node contains arbitrary data, children, and accessor and mutator methods for reading and manipulating
 * tree nodes.
 *
 * In addition to basic accessors and mutators, several handy methods are available.
 * You can convert an instance of a tree node into an object or JSON via `toObject()`
 * and `toJSON()`, you can deep clone an instance via `clone()`, and you can build a new TreeNode from JSON via `TreeNode.fromJSON()`.
 * The JSON methods are useful for storing tree data in a database as JSON and rebuilding the tree later on from said data.
 *
 * In addition, the path of any tree node from the root can be retrieved with `getNodePath()`, and nodes can be
 * selected using an array of sibling indexes via `getSelectionPath()` and `selectNode()`. These are useful for
 * hierarchy traversal and quickly selecting existing nodes. For example, you may want to store a node's selection path and then
 * reselect that same node at a later time in your application. You can also find nodes via `find()` or `findById()` if your nodes use IDs.

   * The default property name for the array of children is `"children"`. This can be customized via `options.childrenPropertyName`.
   *
   * The constructor will recursively create TreeNodes for all children. All other properties will be stored as data for each node.
   *
   * For example, given a nested object such as:
   *
   * ```js
   * { id: 1, children: [

   * }

   * In this case, each node will have data containing the `id` property, and all children will be turned into TreeNodes themselves.
   *
   * To turn the TreeNode back into an object at a later time, use `toObject()`, and to turn it into a JSON string, use `toJSON()`.
   * To construct a TreeNode from JSON, use `TreeNode.fromJSON()`.
   *
   * @param data Optional. An object containing data for the node, plus optional children with subnodes.
